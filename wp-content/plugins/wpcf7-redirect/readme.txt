== Installation ==

Installing Redirection for CF7 can be done either by searching for "Redirection for CF7" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org.
2. Upload the ZIP file through the "Plugins > Add New > Upload" screen in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Visit the settings screen and configure, as desired.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin disable CF7 Ajax? =

No, it doesn't. The plugin does not disable any of Contact Form 7 normal behavior, unlike all other plugins that do the same.

= Does this plugin uses "on_sent_ok" additional setting? =

No. One of the reasons we developed this plugin, is because on_send_ok is now deprecated, and is going to be abolished by the end of 2017. This plugin is the only redirect plugin for CF7 that has been updated to use [DOM events](https://contactform7.com/dom-events/) to perform redirect, as CF7 developer Takayuki Miyoshi recommends.

= How to use files shortcodes =
[{field_name}-filename] - will replace the shortcode with the file name
[{field_name}-base_64_file] - will replace the shortcode with a base64 representation of a file
[{field_name}-path] - will replace the shortcode with the file path on the server
